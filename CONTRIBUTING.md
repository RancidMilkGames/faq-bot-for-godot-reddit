## Before you start

Before you start working on something, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RancidMilkGames/faq-bot-for-godot-reddit/issues) to see if something similar is already being worked on. Also, please reach out on the [Godot Contributors Chat's #Website channel](https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/website) before you begin working on something to make sure it's a good fit for the project, and accepted by the community.

### Things to consider when contributing/discussing

* If you don't like an answer or part of it, please feel free to voice your opinion about it. Remember though that there is no answer to a question that everyone will find perfect, the goal is to form the answers from the community, not an individual. Also, please enter the conversation trying to highlight the perks of what you're thinking instead of starting out with something like "how terrible" you consider something that exists or is being talked about. You can obviously list cons and such, I just want to keep the repo as productive/polite as I can, and to encourage respecting the code of conduct.
* The bot's purpose isn't to replace human made responses that can go in more depth about certain aspects and/or follow up on more questions. It's purpose is to quickly give someone asking a question similar info that you'd see most times it's asked, and to save people answering it the time of typing out general info. The hope is that the person asking either gets the response they want, or can at least further evolve their question, which should better utilize the knowledge and time of those that answer. One possible feature I was thinking of bouncing off the community was having answers include that they can further their question as a comment to the bot so that when real people roll in, they can go into specifics/detail.
* The bot can only convey so much info while remaining concise. One thing I noticed when first asking for feedback is people seemed to want it both short, but to also include things like resources like example projects, tutorials like dodge the creeps, links to the docs, trying to include every single difference between C# and GDScript, etc. I did my best to respect that with the revisions to the response (I'm sure it's still not perfect), but it's a "can't have your cake and eat it too" type situation. I do think there might be some somewhat happy compromises for things like that though though. Like having the community create a full and exhaustive list of the differences between GDScript and C#, which is linked to by the bot, which itself only displays differences of a certain significance followed by that link.
* If for some reason it comes down to it, this bot is official, so the Godot team gets final say on what it does and its answers. I don't really see this being an issue. I mean as far as all the stuff they do concerns, this bot is itty bitty potatoes. You're free to fork the bot's code and run it in your own subreddit if you wish. It doesn't even need to be about Godot if you do that, if you want a FAQ answer reddit bot, feel free to fork it.
* The current answer to GDScript vs C# probably isn't perfect, it's still largely written by me @RancidMilkGames (and with my best efforts, revised by community feedback), but the project is open source so if it isn't the voice of the community, it easily can be made into that.

## Report Issues/Bugs

Please report issues and bugs to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RancidMilkGames/faq-bot-for-godot-reddit/issues).


## Feature Requests

This isn't intended to become a massive project, so for now feature requests will be shared with the issue tracker. If you have a feature request, please submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RancidMilkGames/faq-bot-for-godot-reddit/issues) as well. If the project grows enough to warrant a separate feature request section, it will be added.
