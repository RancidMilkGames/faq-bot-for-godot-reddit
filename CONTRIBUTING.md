## Before you start

Before you start working on something, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RancidMilkGames/faq-bot-for-godot-reddit/issues) to see if something similar is already being worked on. Also, please reach out on the [Godot Contributors Chat's #Website channel](https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/website) before you begin working on something to make sure it's a good fit for the project, and accepted by the community.

## Report Issues/Bugs

Please report issues and bugs to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RancidMilkGames/faq-bot-for-godot-reddit/issues).


## Feature Requests

This isn't intended to become a massive project, so for now feature requests will be shared with the issue tracker. If you have a feature request, please submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RancidMilkGames/faq-bot-for-godot-reddit/issues) as well. If the project grows enough to warrant a separate feature request section, it will be added.
