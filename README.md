# Godot FAQ Answer Bot for reddit

## Notes

* The read me will be completed after more talks with the team.
* I mostly use python for basic scripting, so please feel free to contribute or suggest changes, as I don't normally build applications in it.

## Introduction

This is a reddit bot that answers frequently asked questions about the Godot game engine. It is designed to be a helpful resource for new users and to save time for experienced users. The intention of the bot is only to aid in answering these questions, as it cannot answer follow-up questions or engage in conversation.

## Testing

The bot is currently just a python script. I was planning on running it with PM2 on a server, but now the team is going to use it, I will wait to see how they plan to run it. You can run it just by running main.py, after setting up your .env file. You can use template.env as a starting point for your .env file.

Please only run this bot on a testing subreddit and not on Godot's subreddit, as it will just be spamming the subreddit with the same answers.
