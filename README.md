# Godot FAQ Answer Bot for reddit

## Introduction

This is a reddit bot that answers frequently asked questions about the Godot game engine. It is designed to be a helpful resource for new users and to save time for experienced users. The intention of the bot is only to aid in answering these questions, as it cannot answer follow-up questions or engage in conversation.

## Answers

Currently, the bot only responds to a single question, although, it's the most asked question on the subreddit. If successful, the bot will be expanded to answer more questions.

### Current Answers

* GDScript vs C#

### Planned Answers

* Can Godot make/do X?
* Godot for 3D?

## Features

### Current Features

* Static response to a specific question.

### Possible Features

* Ability to hail the bot for an answer.

## Running/Testing the bot

After setting up your .env file (`template.env` is provided as a template for the .env file.), you can run the bot with `main.py`. 

Please only run this bot on a testing subreddit and not on Godot's subreddit, as it will just be spamming the subreddit with the same answers.
